description:
  Pushes image to docker, or `registry`'s image store.
  * `dockerSocket` must be the correct socket path to the host machine's `dockerd` runtime socket IE `/var/run/docker.sock` (default path). For linux, you can try `netstat -lx | grep docker | grep -Po '/.*docker.sock'` to verify the proper socket file.
  * `imageName` is the name of the image you want to give the resultant image for `docker build`
  * `username` and `password` used to authenticate to registry
